# What inspired me?
This project inspired me by its ability to solve problems in my local.So I am happy to do tasks to solve problems.
And also want to work on **AI** So started with this face recognition system.
> Satisfaction with Solving problems by coding
## So what area can this project solve problems?
I have wide fields to solve for the feature like
- Criminal tracing
- Schools and organization attendance systems
- Security of sensitive residentials
- Digital ID systems
- Door locks

But at this time this project can be used for the online certifying platforms to check if their student itself is working on exams without manual detection.So if many students want to certify at the same time they should be fully validated and also can be managed with this AI system without video calls.

# Introduction

## What is Blenx?

The name given __Blen__ means Amharic word that means human iris and the _X_ also show no more need of the human eye for repetitive jobs and also eyewitness.
## What it is and it does?
Blenx is camera system that can detect human face with computer vision.Help for automating tasks with computer's camera.So you can Install on your systems and This version of the program is working for the __ALX__ Software Engineering Program LogIn with your Email and password for the program then the Exam will start with warning.When you press button start the exam will start.

# About the project

This project is the Simple Demo of Examination for __ALX software Engineering program__ done on the _Portofolio_ project.This project developed with __Python Programming Language__.

- _FaceRecognition
  - _Blenx_GUI.py_ -> GUI design of project 
  - _Screens.kv_ -> kivy source file for the _Blenx_GUI.py_
  - _dataset.py_ -> capture the user data and store with their name and ID
  - _detector.py_ -> Detection module for face detecting 
  - _train.py_ -> It will train the AI using the data stored (captured by dataset)
  - _haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml_ -> the frontal face classifire
